In addition to being one of the top homegrown acts in their musically rich hometown, Gunpoets have become staples at regional festivals such as the Finger Lakes GrassRoots Festival of Music and Dance and the Great Blue Heron Music Festival. Progressively, over the band's eight years together, they have also become in-demand headliners at clubs and concert series across the Northeast. In July 2016, Gunpoets released their third studio album, Bombs Away! The new album's title plays off the hard/soft juxtaposition that underlies the band's name and creative identity. The album is a call to the world to lay down all weapons of war, and to replace them with love, peace, and compassion.

Fronted by the brother/sister duo of guitarist Joe Massa and lead vocalist Amanda Massa, the progressive funk/rock ensemble is rounded out by chosen family from the central New York music scene: the greasy rhythm section of Dan Collins (drums/vocals) and Sterling Clarke (bass), the vintage organ, piano, and synthesizer textures of Samuel B. Lupowitz (keyboards/vocals), and the punchy horn section of Alec Staples (saxophone) and Amanda's husband, Bob McMahon (trumpet).\r\n\r\nSince its founding in 2009, Thru Spectrums has evolved from a stripped-down four-piece to its current formidable incarnation, playing gig after gig across the state. The fruits of the family band's labors manifested last May, with the release of their third album, Process.\r\n\r\n\"It really feels like we're turning a corner,\" says founding member Joe Massa. \"The momentum we've been building, and everyone's individual efforts to make the band stronger... we're becoming the band I've envisioned since starting this thing.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Thru Spectrums loves to unleash familiar numbers by Amy Winehouse, Jimi Hendrix, Fiona Apple, Bruno Mars, and other influential artists, this band emphasizes original music with twists and turns, peaks and valleys, and grooves for days. The genre-bending journey of Process will take the listener through Steely Dan-esque groove rock (\"To the Daylight,\" \"What You Say\"), 1960s soul (\"Juniper in Spring\"), Stevie Wonder-inspired ballads (\"Long Lost\"), and Parliament party-funk (the nine-minute opus \"Social Misfit\"). Along with proudly unveiling the new recording, the band has also been honing their live show relentlessly as the Thru Spectrums star continues to rise.\r\n\r\nKeep an eye out for Thru Spectrums bringing their unique brand of funk to a bar, park, or auditorium near you.
