   "long_description": "<p>osh Oxford graduated in 2007 with a degree in percussion performance from Ithaca College. Seeking an outlet for his keyboard playing and love of vintage keyboards and synthesizers, Josh started a jazz quintet, consisting of drums, bass, vibes, trumpet, and Oxford on keyboards. The OXtet quickly evolved into something far more devious than simply playing jazz standards. Over the years guitar and sax was added to fill out the ensemble and create the unique blend of acoustic and electronic instruments. The music takes from the rhythmic complexities inherent in the music of Frank Zappa and the Mahavishnu Orchestra; the funk aspects of 80s Miles Davis; and compositional techniques used in modern classical music, such as atonality and 12-Tone serialism. The ensemble mainly uses Ithaca College students to perform the music, after Josh’s tragic car accident. Occasionally the original group will perform in the Ithaca area.</p>",

   "long_description": "<p>Born an Army brat, Kurt Riley has been on the road all his life. Relocating from state to state often as a boy, he turned to art and fiction as solace from the loneliness that life granted. Stemming from a conservative upbringing, he sought an escape from that stifling mindset; the exodus was granted at fourteen years old, when he discovered The Rolling Stones. Further galvanized by Delta blues, Chess Records, and classic R&B, Riley taught himself how to sing and play both the guitar and harmonica a year later. Subsequently, enthralled by Fifties rock and roll and the brilliant groups of the British Invasion, he began composing original songs of his own in earnest. Along the way, he added piano, synthesizer, drums, maracas, castanets, tambourine, bass guitar and slide guitar to his palette, composing increasingly melodic, richly interwoven pop songs. Riley's influences grew to include glam rock, Moroccan ritual music, new wave, 1930s pop standards, and Eighties post-punk. All of these and more informed a rich, diverse style of songwriting, which combines disparate elements in new ways while preserving the rockabilly energy and Delta blues grit that first inspired him in the first place.</p>",

The event was paired with the release of the band's fourth studio album, Talk, which they have been actively touring the country in support of.

Years of record collecting, including stints as a reviewer for Webster’s Weekly (one of the first web-only periodicals) and as a writer for 14850.com magazine, have given him a depth of musical knowledge and a taste for the obscure. All of this listening has helped Alan develop a talent for turning universal emotions into memorable lyrics.

It wasn't until recent years that he began to realize what he really wanted out of life for himself and for those around him,and began focusing seriously on his music. His lyrical style and content is heavily influenced by his experiences growing up in the Red Hook projects, as well as by the people and friends that he has worked with musically; Trey Skoolz, Dj Dream, TerrorDome, Rising Sun & The GunPoets, Silvaa, Dj Sma,Ra Dollas, Krayze & Hot, Youngin,Willie\" Champ\" Monroe, Jae Prodigy, Caleo Latin bay, Lil Jay,D-Rock, Eazy Thai Boy, Money Mars,Korey Bolden, Dj Davito, Yung Eddie. Like many of us, Ave Mack is inspired by the career and musical accomplishments of Shawn Carter (Jay-Z), also a Brooklyn native, who struggled with poverty and crime and rejection in the music game before becoming one of the most influential figures in hip hop today. Ave's alias is a reference to both the ave where he grew up in Red Hook, paired with his families government name; representing where he came from by making it a part of who he hopes to become. Ave has performed primarily in upstate NY; his music has been featured on the Tim Westwood Show in the UK and select songs can also be found on mixtapes in New York and Georgia</p>",

The baby of six children, it was not long before his parents and older siblings realized that he was a very gifted vocalist and musician. As a member of this very spiritual family it was almost destined that young Michael would be part of the church choir. There, he expanded his vocal ability while embracing his religion. As a teenager he started to apply his vocal skills to making reggae compositions with sweet melodies and hooks in a style very characteristic of the R&B he had been singing earlier in his life but with rich cultural and spiritual content. This is why he took the name \"Jamelody\" (Jah Melody) It was at a captivating performance as an opening act for a reggae show in Port of Spain which brought him to the attention of his current manager who immediately took him to Jamaica to begin recording. On a second trip to Jamaica he was introduced to Bobby \"Digital\" Dixon, ace producer and owner of the well known record label Digital B. The sweet sound of Jamelody -- as heard on the single \"Pressure\", taken from his forthcoming VP album,to be released in September 2007 -- is a result of their amazing collaborative effort and musical chemistry.</p>",

There will be 3 DJs spinning at all times. Each partygoer will be able to tune into 1 DJ at a time and switch as often as they like, and the color of the lights in the headphones will change accordingly. Find people with the same color lights and boogie to the same groove! Or do the opposite and see how weird you can get!</p>"
