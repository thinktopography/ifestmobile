All of this listening has helped Alan develop a talent for turning universal emotions into memorable lyrics.

   "description": "<p>hip-hop</p>",
   "long_description": "<p>Ave Mack was born Rahmel Mack on January 27, in Brooklyn, NY. Ave's childhood in Brooklyn left him wanting more out of his life than what he saw around him. Always interested in music and rhymes, Ave began writing while still young, but thought that a life and career in music was an impossible dream. It wasn't until recent years that he began to realize what he really wanted out of life for himself and for those around him,and began focusing seriously on his music. His lyrical style and content is heavily influenced by his experiences growing up in the Red Hook projects, as well as by the people and friends that he has worked with musically; Trey Skoolz, Dj Dream, TerrorDome, Rising Sun & The GunPoets, Silvaa, Dj Sma,Ra Dollas, Krayze & Hot, Youngin,Willie\" Champ\" Monroe, Jae Prodigy, Caleo Latin bay, Lil Jay,D-Rock, Eazy Thai Boy, Money Mars,Korey Bolden, Dj Davito, Yung Eddie. Like many of us, Ave Mack is inspired by the career and musical accomplishments of Shawn Carter (Jay-Z), also a Brooklyn native, who struggled with poverty and crime and rejection in the music game before becoming one of the most influential figures in hip hop today. Ave's alias is a reference to both the ave where he grew up in Red Hook, paired with his families government name; representing where he came from by making it a part of who he hopes to become. Ave has performed primarily in upstate NY; his music has been featured on the Tim Westwood Show in the UK and select songs can also be found on mixtapes in New York and Georgia</p>",

   "long_description": "<p>When Danielle Ponder and the Tomorrow People hit the stage things get torqued up quickly like a tent revival during tornado season. Named Top Ten Bands to watch by CityPaper, and winner of the 2015 and 2016 Roc Awards, \"Best Band\", Danielle Ponder and the Tomorrow People transcend musical genres with a blast of deep, powerful groove and soul. The band is the groove while Ponder’s pipes keep it rooted in soul. And according to Ponder, soul is more than a sound.</p><p>\n“Soul music is something you feel,” she says. “It gives you goose bumps.”\n\nThis Rochester, NY Native has spent the past years rendering goose bumps by perfecting her style and charismatic performance. She sings, you listen, you melt. The result of her focus and dedication is a tone that is both enchanting and seductive along with a riveting, honest stage presence. It is this voice that has helped her secure gigs opening up for powerhouses such as George Clinton, Ledisi and The Roots.  The band has also completed two successful European tours. Boyd Kletter of Bourbon Street Blues Club in Amsterdam said \"Danielle shines bright both on and off the stage. She's truly is a star!\"\n\nIn 2016 the singer released her debut EP Blow Out The Sun. Soultracks.com said  “Ponder’s vocals combine the spirit of the church with the speak-truth- to-power assertiveness of a movement leader. “  Jeff Spevak of the Democrat & Chronicle wrote \"Ponder’s tough-sounding vocals on “Three Word Revolution (I Love Myself)” is a defiant call to self worth. That title track feels custom built as a room-shaking anthem for women in the audience.” In 2016 the band would also enter the AfroPunk Battle of the Bands contest, where they surpassed hundreds of bands and made it to the final four.\n\nBeyond Danielle's musical talent, she is a passionate defense attorney, speaker and activist. Danielle has dedicated the past 15 years to organizing and speaking up for marginalized communities. She has worked on issues such as education funding, women's rights, and has spent the past 8 years working for criminal justice reform. Danielle was recently highlighted by the American Bar Association. In 2017 she created the Multi-Media show \"For the Love of Justice\", where she shines light on our criminal justice system through powerful lyrics and thought provoking visuals. \n\nDr. Karen Stote of WIlfred Laurier University called \" For the Love of Justice\" an \"impactful and uplifting performance\"\n\nThis sensational singer lists powerful influences that lit her fuse like Nina Simone, Big Mama Thornton, Shirley Chilsolm, Cornel West and Lauryn Hill. Ponder opens her mouth to sing or speak and it’s readily apparent; there’s another name that belongs in that pantheon as well. Danielle Ponder, and her time is now.</p>",

Hints of Hank, Merle, and George give every song it's prominent roots influence but the songs remain obviously personal and honest.  Drew, from California, moved here in 2017 and began writing original songs about travelin, boozin, and breakin hearts....mostly his own. Backed by local music scene heros: Joe Hayward on banjo/pedal steel (Ithaca Bottom Boys), Seth Gregory on stand-up bass (Mill Bastards/Pine Box), and Sid Burke on fiddle (Mill Bastards/Pine Box), the sound is authentic and timeless.  From busking for dollars, to becoming a headlining act, Drew Kiddoo and the Blackouts has recently evolved adding Tristen Ross on mandolin (Ithaca Bottom Boys), Jason Shegogue on electric guitar (Lady D and the Shadow Spirits), Sam Schmidt on second fiddle (Alexander Bradshaw Band), and Kieran Riley on drums (Revel Makes).  The band is currently recording its first full length album which will be released in May 2019.</p>",

The baby of six children, it was not long before his parents and older siblings realized that he was a very gifted vocalist and musician. As a member of this very spiritual family it was almost destined that young Michael would be part of the church choir. There, he expanded his vocal ability while embracing his religion. As a teenager he started to apply his vocal skills to making reggae compositions with sweet melodies and hooks in a style very characteristic of the R&B he had been singing earlier in his life but with rich cultural and spiritual content. This is why he took the name \"Jamelody\" (Jah Melody) It was at a captivating performance as an opening act for a reggae show in Port of Spain which brought him to the attention of his current manager who immediately took him to Jamaica to begin recording. On a second trip to Jamaica he was introduced to Bobby \"Digital\" Dixon, ace producer and owner of the well known record label Digital B. The sweet sound of Jamelody -- as heard on the single \"Pressure\", taken from his forthcoming VP album,to be released in September 2007 -- is a result of their amazing collaborative effort and musical chemistry.</p>",
