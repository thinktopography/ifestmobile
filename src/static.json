Gray grew up together in Ithaca, NY and have been writing, recording, and producing songs as a trio since they met in kindergarten. Luca's vivid lyrical inventions, Christian's improvisational vocal prowess, and Jackson's skills in instrumental arranging and studio composition came together to establish their sound from a young age. Their music is evocative of early rock \u0026 roll, Motown, 1960s rhythm \u0026 blues, and the mid century rock of Gold Star Studios. Greenspun's catchy, romantic lyrics cut through a sonic backdrop of booming, powerful drums; deep fretless jazz bass; lyrical guitar phrases; and rag-timed striding drawbar organ. In late 2015, the Horses expanded as a group with the addition of a number of musicians. Among these new members were rock \u0026 roll drummer Galen Marteal, jazz bassist Rafael Encisco, rock guitarist Eli Haines-Eitzen, and engineer Jacob Friga to bring their works to the public.

Few bands can trace their roots all the way back to a specific set of values shared in casual conversation among good friends; in the case of Big Mean Sound Machine, honoring the ideas the group was founded on seems to be more of an instinct than a choice. Big Mean is contemporary proof that it’s possible to create art that stimulates the body while also challenging the mind to explore beyond the status quo. “For the listener who stops shaking to pay attention at a Big Mean show, they can find a musical education,” writes Josh Brokaw of The Ithaca Times. Borrowing elements from traditional afrobeat, roots reggae, ethiojazz, and funk among others, “Big Mean’s [style] is not easily captured by the precise, genre-parsing descriptors of a contemporary music press that’s uncomfortable admitting to being surprised with a new sound,” writes Brokaw.  Their instrumental soundscapes have no overt messages yet they’re anything but barren.  “You get the feeling of walking the streets in a city late at night as those who are up to no good are coming out of their homes searching for their next score,” writes Bryan Lasky of NYSmusic.com.  “Seamed together by an amazing rhythm section… the core of the group commands attention while providing a passionate and constant groove,” boasts Vinyl Fluid Records, noting the fact that this purely instrumental band stimulates audiences both physically and cerebrally, though devoid of vocal indoctrination.  The theme the band delivers again and again through evolving rhythms and melodies is to enjoy music for its creativity and musicality, and the way it makes you feel in every sense of being able to feel.","url":"http://www.bigmeansoundmachine.com","stage_id":125211,"stage":"Bernie Milton","day_id":125215,"day":"Saturday, June 3","time":"8:00 - 10:00","photo":"https://sitemandala.imgix.net/assets/108910/big-mean.png","photo_caption":""},{"id":125659,"title":"The Blind Spots","description":"Moxy Rock","long_description":"This all original, five-piece moxy rock band steered by magnetic songstress and force of nature Maddy Walsh has been actively touring the country after the release of its third studio album, RHIZOMATIC, which was accompanied by several music videos released at two sold-out premieres in their hometown of Ithaca, NY.

In addition to being one of the top homegrown acts in their musically rich hometown, Gunpoets have become staples at regional festivals such as the Finger Lakes GrassRoots Festival of Music and Dance and the Great Blue Heron Music Festival. Progressively, over the band's eight years together, they have also become in-demand headliners at clubs and concert series across the Northeast. In July 2016, Gunpoets released their third studio album, Bombs Away! The new album's title plays off the hard/soft juxtaposition that underlies the band's name and creative identity.
