        <h4>CELEBRATING THE ARTIST IN EVERYONE SINCE 1977!</h4>
        <h5><b>What is Ithaca Festival?</b></h5>

        <p>The Ithaca Festival is a four day music and arts celebration, the premier event of its kind in Tompkins
          County. Over 1,000 talented local musicians, painters, dancers, clowns, community groups, and ensembles
          perform throughout the Ithaca Festival weekend. Enjoy multiple stages of entertainment, some special kid’s
          activities, a craft show, a parade, a local film festival, an arts for social justice area, and delicious
          festival food at various locations.
        </p>
        <h5><b>Our Mission</b></h5>

        <p>Celebrating the artist in everyone and supporting arts in the community!
        </p>
        <h5><b>History</b></h5>

        <p>The Ithaca Festival began in 1977 as an arts festival called “Celebration Ithaca.” Over the years, the Ithaca
          Festival has taken many creative forms under a long tradition of excellent leadership by festival directors.
          Through it all, we have always remained true to our roots and to our mission to celebrate the artist in
          everyone. We provide a concentrated outlet for the artistic output of our greater community, from our favorite
          kazoo band to the nationally touring performer. The Ithaca Festival kicks off the summer with a fun, diverse,
          delicious, whimsical experience that we look forward to creating for many years to come.
        </p>
        <h5><b>Who's Behind the Scenes?</b></h5>

        <p>A volunteer Board of Directors establishes festival policy. A full-time Executive Director and Assistant
          Director plan the festival and several seasonal part-time staff members oversee various programs and projects.
          During festival weekend, the majority of work support is provided by more than 100 volunteers.
        </p>
        <h5><b>How Are We Funded?</b></h5>

        <p>The Ithaca Festival is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization and a self-sustaining festival. The City of Ithaca
          does not provide financial support but they donate many in-kind services such as police and fire department
          power. The revenue from this year’s festival will ensure that the festival will return next year. The majority
          of our funding comes from the sale of t-shirts and buttons with sponsorships and the sale of vending real
          estate filling out the rest of our budget. Tax-deductible donations are greatly appreciated! Please write to
          Executive Director Danielle Klock at director@ithacafestival.org for details.
